const name = "Madhura"
const age = 35

//Concatanation 
console.log(name + age + "Engineer"); //Not Recommended

//Interpolation
console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`);

/*
Way of declaring string

1. const name = "Madhura"
2. const name = new String('Madhura') - this declaration gives lots of methods
Examples are below this comments
*/

const name1 = new String('Madhura')
